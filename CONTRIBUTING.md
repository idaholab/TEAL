TEAL is a RAVEN Plugin and as such follows the RAVEN Python standards
[RAVEN standards](https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki/Developer_Information).

To maintain quality assurance, development in TEAL is issue-driven; that is,
new development should be based on resolving a submitted issue (task or defect).
New development ideally should not be commenced until at least one associated
issue has been reviewed (via the Issue Review checklist) and approved for
development by the Change Control Board (CCB).

New development is performed either on development branches using
a developer's fork of TEAL. To merge
developments into the main `devel` branch, a Pull Request is created
referencing the issue that incited the development, and a review performed by
a member of the CCB (via the Change Request Review checklist).
