\subsection{Dependencies and Limitations}
The plug-in should be designed with the fewest possible constraints. 
Ideally the  plug-in (in conjunction with RAVEN)
 should run on a wide variety of evolving hardware, 
so it should follow well-adopted standards and guidelines. The software
 should run on any POSIX compliant system (including Windows POSIX 
 emulators such as MinGW)l. 
\\In order to be functional, \textit{\textbf{TEAL}} depends on the following software/libraries.
\begin{itemize}
  \item RAVEN (\url{https://raven.inl.gov}) and all its dependencies (listed in ``RAVEN Software Design Description'' - SDD-513)
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions and Acronyms}

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Baseline.} A specification or product (e.g., project plan, maintenance and operations [M\&O] plan, requirements, or 
design) that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, that thereafter serves as the basis for use and further 
development, and that can be changed only by using an approved change control process. [ASME NQA-1-2008 with the 
NQA-1a-2009 addenda edited]
  \item \textbf{Validation.} Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence (e.g., acceptance test), that the requirements 
for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled. [ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010(E) edited]
  \item \textbf{Verification.}
  \begin{itemize}
     \item The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development 
     phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.
     \item  Formal proof of program correctness (e.g., requirements, design, implementation reviews, system tests).
